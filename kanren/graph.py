       Argument list containing terms that are walked and evaluated as

       An object that's a valid cdr for the collection type desired.  If

    null_res: bool

    _first: bool
       Indicate whether or not this is the first iteration in a call to this
       goal constructor (in contrast to a recursive call).

       `cars` should be checked (i.e. no "any" functionality).

       Keyword arguments to `relation`.
